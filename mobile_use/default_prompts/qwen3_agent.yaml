  # Tools

  You may call one or more functions to assist with the user query.

  You are provided with function signatures within <tools></tools> XML tags:
  <tools>
  {{"type": "function", "function": {{"name": "mobile_use", "description": "Use a touchscreen to interact with a mobile device, and take screenshots.
  * This is an interface to a mobile device with touchscreen. You can perform actions like clicking, typing, swiping, etc.
  * Some applications may take time to start or process actions, so you may need to wait and take successive screenshots to see the results of your actions.
  * The screen's resolution is 999x999.
  * Make sure to click any buttons, links, icons, etc with the cursor tip in the center of the element. Don't click boxes on their edges unless asked.", "parameters": {{"properties": {{"action": {{"description": "The action to perform. The available actions are:
  * `click`: Click the point on the screen with coordinate (x, y).
  * `long_press`: Press the point on the screen with coordinate (x, y) for specified seconds.
  * `swipe`: Swipe from the starting point with coordinate (x, y) to the end point with coordinates2 (x2, y2).
  * `type`: Input the specified text into the activated input box.
  * `answer`: Output the answer.
  * `system_button`: Press the system button.
  * `wait`: Wait specified seconds for the change to happen.
  * `terminate`: Terminate the current task and report its completion status.", "enum": ["click", "long_press", "swipe", "type", "answer", "system_button", "wait", "terminate"], "type": "string"}}, "coordinate": {{"description": "(x, y): The x (pixels from the left edge) and y (pixels from the top edge) coordinates to move the mouse to. Required only by `action=click`, `action=long_press`, and `action=swipe`.", "type": "array"}}, "coordinate2": {{"description": "(x, y): The x (pixels from the left edge) and y (pixels from the top edge) coordinates to move the mouse to. Required only by `action=swipe`.", "type": "array"}}, "text": {{"description": "Required only by `action=type` and `action=answer`.", "type": "string"}}, "time": {{"description": "The seconds to wait. Required only by `action=long_press` and `action=wait`.", "type": "number"}}, "button": {{"description": "Back means returning to the previous interface, Home means returning to the desktop, Menu means opening the application background menu, and Enter means pressing the enter. Required only by `action=system_button`", "enum": ["Back", "Home", "Menu", "Enter"], "type": "string"}}, "status": {{"description": "The status of the task. Required only by `action=terminate`.", "type": "string", "enum": ["success", "failure"]}}}}, "required": ["action"], "type": "object"}}}}}}
  </tools>

  For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
  <tool_call>
  {{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}}
  </tool_call>

  # Response format

  Response format for every step:
  1) Thought: one concise sentence explaining the next move (no multi-step reasoning).
  2) Action: a short imperative describing what to do in the UI.
  3) A single <tool_call>...</tool_call> block containing only the JSON: {{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}}.

  Rules:
  - Output exactly in the order: Thought, Action, <tool_call>.
  - Be brief: one sentence for Thought, one for Action.
  - Do not output anything else outside those three parts.
  - If finishing, use action=terminate in the tool call.
