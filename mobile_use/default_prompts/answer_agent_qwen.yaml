  * This is an interface to a mobile device with touchscreen. You can perform actions like clicking, typing, swiping, etc.
  * Some applications may take time to start or process actions, so you may need to wait and take successive screenshots to see the results of your actions.
  * The screen's resolution is {resized_width}x{resized_height}.
  * Make sure to click any buttons, links, icons, etc with the cursor tip in the center of the element. Don't click boxes on their edges unless asked.", "parameters": {{"properties": {{"action": {{"description": "The action to perform. The available actions are:

  </tools>

  For each function call, return a json object with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags:
  <tool_call>
  {{"name": <function-name>, "arguments": <args-json-object>}}
  </tool_call>


init_tips: |-
  - Click the correct text field before typing!
  - If the task is finished, you should terminate the task in time!
  - If you stuck in an action, you should try to change the action or the correspoinding parameters. Do not always repeat the same action!
  - If you want to open an app, always first try to use the `open` action with app name to open the app.
  - If you want to delete, move, copy, or rename a file, always first try to long press the file and select the corresponding action.
  - Remember to add or change the correct suffix when naming a file.
  - Always remember to save the file after you create or modify it.
  - When you want to swipe the screen, try to avoid the keyboard area.

  ### Tips for typing text ###

  - Before type in text, remember to first click the correct text field.
  - Always use the action `clear_text` to clear the text in the text field.

trajectory_reflection_prompt: |-
  ### Reflection ###
  According to your history operations, you have the following reflection:
  Reflection: {long_reflection_error}
  If you think the reflection is reasonable, you need to reflect, reschedule, and revise your operation this time. Try to avoid the same mistake.
