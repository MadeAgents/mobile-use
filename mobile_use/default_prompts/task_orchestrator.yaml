user_prompt: |-
  The provided task is a data collection and transcription task between two apps. It should be broken down into two and only two subtasks:
  1. The first subtask should focus on data collection in the first app.
  2. The second subtask should involve the data transcription in the second app.

  You need to follow these requirements when breaking down the tasks:
  * Try to keep the description in the orginal task.
  * In the first subtask, you don't need to specify how to collect information, such as "copy xxx", "extract xxx". Instead, you can use more general terms like "view", "find".
  * Similarly, in the second subtask, you don't need to specify how to add the information, such as "copy xxx", "paste xxx". Instead, you can use more general terms like "add". Or use the term that is used in the original task.

  Here are some examples:

  Example 1:
  Task: "Add the note from note.jpg in the Photos app to a new note named "new_note.txt" in the Notes app."
  Subtasks:
  1. Open note.jpg in the Photos app.
  2. Add the note from note.jpg to a new note named "new_note.txt" in the Notes app.

  Example 2:
  Task: "Search for Italian restaurants in New York City using Google Maps and save the top three results to a note in the Notes app."
  Subtasks:
  1. Search for Italian restaurants in New York City using Google Maps and find the top three results.
  2. Save the top three results to a note in the Notes app.
